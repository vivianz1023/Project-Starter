# Movie Wish List

## Track Movies you want to watch

This application is a **movie wish list**.

Users can *add* movies they want to watch to this list. A list of *movie names* can be shown on the list.
Users can select a movie and see its *film type* and *film score*. After they watch the movie or do not want to watch
it anymore, they can *delete* movies from the list. This application will be suitable for most people in society
who love watching movies. The reason why choosing the movie wish list as the topic is that, in daily life,
when people talk about film-related topics or see videos and advertisements of recommended movies, they will always
have the idea that I want to see that movie. However, when people want to see a film in their spare time, many of them
say it is challenging to think of a film name they wish to watch. Therefore, they can use the movie wish list to add
the movie to the list in time so that when they choose a film, it will be much more *convenient*.
